# DCSS Fork

This DCSS fork (currently unnamed) is based on a fork called Kimchi, which restored many of the removals from the mainline Crawl, and added some features on top of that. 
Currently, it's mostly the same as Kimchi, but with some of the mainline changes merged, like spell hunger removal and certain reworks.
